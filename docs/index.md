# Nationwide Resilience Hubs
*A citizen-built, open, auditable fallback for messaging when cellular/Internet fail — from neighborhood to nationwide.*

**Start here:**

- 👉 **Pilot Pack**: [docs/pilot-pack.md](./pilot-pack.md)
- ✅ **Quickstart (Local Hub)**: build a one-line dial-up BBS + VHF packet node.
- 🔐 **Licensing**: docs are CC BY-SA 4.0, code is Apache-2.0, hardware is CERN OHL-W v2.

## Layers
- **Tier 0:** HF backbone (Winlink/JS8/NBEMS + DTN/BPv7)
- **Tier 1:** Regional packet hubs (AX.25 + LinBPQ)
- **Tier 2:** Local hubs (dial-up BBS + VHF packet + optional mesh)
- **Tier 3:** Edge users (modems, packet kits, printed forms)

## Get involved
- File issues and PRs on GitHub.
- Sign commits with DCO.
- Join quarterly drills and publish metrics/logs.
