# Nationwide Resilience Hubs — Public Launch

**What:** An open, auditable fallback message network for communities during outages — from neighborhood BBS nodes to an HF backbone.

**Why:** Cellular and Internet are resilient but not invulnerable. Our layered design is simple, drillable, and transparent.

**What’s different:**
- Open licenses and reproducible releases
- Transparent configs and logs (no black boxes)
- Human-run, community-operated hubs; no lock-in
