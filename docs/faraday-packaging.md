# Faraday Packaging — Nested Shielding for Spares
*Docs: CC BY-SA 4.0*

This method protects spare electronics from strong EM transients (including EMP). It uses **alternating dielectric and conductive layers** plus a conductive outer container.

**Stack (inside → out):** **D–C–D–C–D–C**
1. **D:** Device in a plain plastic zip bag (keeps metal off electronics)
2. **C:** Tight aluminum foil wrap (overlap seams 2–3 cm; seal with aluminum tape)
3. **D:** Bubble wrap/cardboard (5–10 mm) around foil
4. **C:** Second aluminum foil wrap (full coverage again; tape seams)
5. **D:** Rigid liner inside the container (cardboard/foam so nothing touches walls)
6. **C:** Metal ammo can or gasketed metal box (bond lid-to-body with conductive tape or finger-stock)

**Tips**
- No gaps: treat seams like roofing—overlap and tape.
- No bridges: nothing inside should touch the metal wall.
- Keep all **cables/batteries disconnected**; coils act like antennas.
- Add **desiccant**; label contents + date.

**Quick check**
- AM/FM radio should go quiet when sealed. A phone call may still ring (coarse test only).

**Backbone spares kit**
- Complete spare path: Pi/mini-PC → TNC/USB radio modem → radio → mic/PTT cable → power brick/regulator → short coax tail.
- For larger radios: inner metal cookie tin (insulated) inside the ammo can.

**Installed hubs**
- Don’t “air-gap” operating power; instead use cascaded SPDs, isolation, filtering, and **DC-first** power. Keep this Faraday pack for cold spares.
