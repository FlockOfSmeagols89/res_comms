# Operations SOP (condensed)

1. Normal: nightly sync, monthly net.
2. Outage: prioritize life safety (A), then welfare (B), then bulletins (C). Enable quotas.
3. Message handling: validate header, log, route, confirm or expire, archive.
4. Auth: verify PGP signature if present (no encryption on amateur RF).
5. After-action: export logs, publish metrics, patch configs.
