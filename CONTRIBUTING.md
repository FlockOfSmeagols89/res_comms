# Contributing

We welcome issues and PRs. To preserve provenance and clarity:

- Sign your commits with the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**:
  - Add `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` to each commit.
- Keep configs and code **reproducible** (pin versions; record seeds).
- Include/update **checksums** in `RELEASES/` when cutting a release.

## Development
- Keep docs under CC BY-SA 4.0, code under Apache-2.0, hardware under CERN-OHL-W v2.
- Use `data/templates/` for message forms; keep PII out of sample data.

Thanks for helping communities communicate during outages!
